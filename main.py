Think of a GUI program as Even Driven program, meaning it has to be receptive to user interaction, such as the click of
a button or mouse movement. You cannot sleep the screen or use the import time module above as you need to be able to stop, start, 
or reset the program when the GUI is interacted with. This program is driven through our .mainloop() at the end of code.
